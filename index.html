    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a creative and diligent professional with a strong background in game
      studies and digital cultures. My academic journey began at the University
      of Opole, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Game Studies. Currently, I
      am furthering my education by pursuing a Master's degree in Digital
      Cultures, which allows me to explore the intersection of technology,
      media, and society.
      <br />
      <br />
      My passion for digital creation extends beyond academia. I possess
      advanced skills in graphic design, with proficiency in industry-standard
      software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. This expertise enables
      me to bring visual concepts to life and contribute effectively to
      design-oriented projects.
      <br />
      <br />
      In my spare time, I am dedicated to expanding my skill set in web
      development and game creation. This self-driven learning not only
      showcases my commitment to personal growth but also enhances my
      programming abilities in both procedural and object-oriented languages.
      These pursuits reflect my adaptability and eagerness to embrace new
      technologies in the ever-evolving digital landscape.
      <br />
      <br />
      My unique combination of theoretical knowledge and practical skills in
      game studies, digital cultures, graphic design, and programming positions
      me as a versatile candidate capable of contributing innovatively to
      multidisciplinary projects in the digital realm.
